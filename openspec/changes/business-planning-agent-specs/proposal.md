# Proposal: Define Business Planning Agent Specs

**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Author**: Augment CLI  
**Type**: AI Agent Specification  

## Overview

Define comprehensive specifications for the Business Planning Agent - an AI agent that generates business plans, market projections, financial models, and strategic recommendations for projects and ventures.

## Problem Statement

Creating comprehensive business plans requires:

- Extensive market research
- Financial modeling expertise
- Competitive analysis
- Strategic planning skills
- Industry knowledge
- Time and resources

Without a Business Planning Agent, entrepreneurs and project teams must manually:
- Research markets and competitors
- Build financial models
- Create projections
- Write business plans
- Update plans as conditions change

## Proposed Solution

Create a Business Planning Agent that:

1. **Generates business plans** from minimal input
2. **Creates financial models** with projections
3. **Analyzes markets** and competition
4. **Provides strategic recommendations**
5. **Updates plans** based on new data
6. **Produces investor-ready documents**

## Scope

### In Scope
- Business plan generation
- Financial modeling and projections
- Market analysis
- Competitive analysis
- Strategic recommendations
- Document generation (PDF, DOCX)

### Out of Scope
- Legal document generation (separate service)
- Investor matching (future enhancement)
- Pitch deck design (separate tool)
- Real-time market data feeds (future enhancement)

## Agent Specification

### Purpose
Generate comprehensive business plans, market projections, and financial models with minimal user input, leveraging AI and market research data.

### Capabilities

#### 1. Business Plan Generation

**Input Requirements**:
- Business idea/description

**Generation Process**:
```python
class BusinessPlanGenerator:
    """Generates comprehensive business plans."""
    
    def generate_plan(self, input_data: BusinessIdea) -> BusinessPlan:
        """Generate complete business plan from idea."""
        
        # Step 1: Market research
        market_data = self.research_agent.research_market(
            industry=input_data.industry,
            target_market=input_data.target_market
        )
        
        # Step 2: Competitive analysis
        competitors = self.research_agent.analyze_competitors(
            industry=input_data.industry,
            keywords=input_data.keywords
        )
        
        # Step 3: Financial modeling
        financial_model = self.create_financial_model(
            revenue_model=input_data.revenue_model,
            market_size=market_data.market_size,
            assumptions=input_data.assumptions
        )
        
        # Step 4: Generate sections using AI
        plan = BusinessPlan()
        
        plan.executive_summary = self.generate_executive_summary(
            input_data, market_data, financial_model
        )
        
        plan.market_analysis = self.generate_market_analysis(
            market_data, competitors
        )
        
        plan.financial_projections = financial_model

            arr = mrr * 12
            
            # Churn
            churned_customers = new_customers * assumptions.get("churn_rate", 0.05)
            net_customers = new_customers - churned_customers
            
            # Costs

            # Profitability
            gross_profit = arr - cogs
            operating_profit = arr - total_costs
            
            projections.append(YearProjection(

    messages=[{
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an expert business plan writer."
    }, {
        "role": "user",
        "content": f"""Generate an executive summary for this business:
        
        Idea: {business_idea}
        Market: {market_data}
        Financials: {financial_summary}
        
        Make it compelling and investor-ready."""
    }]
)

executive_summary = response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Claude API
**Purpose**: Long-form analysis and strategic recommendations

## Configuration
