**Status**: Draft → Ready for Review  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Type**: Foundational Specification  

## Overview

This change proposal defines the complete core system specifications for Project Starter Pro 2, establishing the architectural foundation for all future development.

## What's Included

### 1. System Architecture (`specs/architecture/system-architecture.md`)
- Overall system structure and component relationships
- Hybrid modular architecture (Python + Node.js)
- Data flow and communication patterns
- Deployment models (local and team modes)
- Directory structure and organization
- Technology stack summary

### 2. Core Modules (`specs/modules/core-modules.md`)
- **Project Manager**: Project lifecycle management
- **Task Orchestrator**: Task planning and execution
- **Research Engine**: Information gathering and synthesis
- **Analytics Engine**: Data analysis and insights
- **Template Manager**: Project templates and scaffolding
- **Integration Hub**: External service connections
- **Configuration Manager**: System and project settings

### 3. Data Models (`specs/data/data-models.md`)
- Project, Task, Research, Analytics Report schemas
- Template and Integration configuration models
- System configuration structure
- Data relationships and validation rules
- Storage strategy and organization
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 4. API Contracts (`specs/api/api-contracts.md`)
- Internal Python APIs for all core modules
- CLI command structure and interface
- REST API endpoints (optional team mode)
- Integration APIs for external services
- Error handling and response formats
- Versioning and rate limiting strategies

### 5. Development Standards (`specs/standards/development-standards.md`)
- Code style guides (Python, TypeScript, Bash)
- Testing requirements and frameworks
- Documentation standards and templates
- Version control and Git workflow
- Code review process
- Deployment procedures

### 6. Security Framework (`specs/security/security-framework.md`)
- Authentication mechanisms (local and team modes)
- Authorization model (RBAC and ACL)
- Data protection (encryption at rest and in transit)
- Credential management strategies
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging and compliance

## Key Decisions

### Architecture
- **Hybrid approach**: Python for core logic, Node.js for CLI/tooling
- **Local-first**: Full functionality without external dependencies
- **File-based storage**: JSON/YAML/Markdown for simplicity and portability
- **Modular design**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to extend

### Technology Stack
- **Python**: 3.13.5+ with `uv`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `black`
- **Node.js**: 20 LTS with `pnpm`, `vitest`, `eslint`, `prettier`
- **AI Integration**: Augment CLI via OpenSpec workflow
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits

### Security
- **Local mode**: OS-level authentication, file permissions
- **Team mode**: JWT-based authentication, RBAC authorization
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data
- **Credentials**: Environment variables or OS keyring

### Development
- **Testing**: 80% minimum coverage, 100% for critical paths
- **Documentation**: Required for all public APIs
- **Code Review**: Required for all changes
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

## Success Criteria

- [x] System architecture defined
- [x] All core modules specified
- [x] Data models documented
- [x] API contracts established
- [x] Development standards set
- [x] Security framework defined
- [ ] Specifications reviewed and approved
- [ ] Implementation can begin with clear guidance

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Team reviews all specifications for completeness and accuracy
2. **Feedback**: Incorporate feedback and refine specifications
3. **Approval**: Get formal approval to proceed
4. **Apply**: Use `/openspec-apply` to begin implementation
5. **Archive**: Move approved specs to `openspec/specs/` and archive this change

## How to Use These Specs

### For Developers
- Reference specs when implementing features
- Follow coding standards and patterns
- Use data models as source of truth
- Implement APIs according to contracts

### For Architects
- Use as foundation for system design decisions
- Extend specs for new features via OpenSpec proposals
- Ensure consistency across components
- Guide technical discussions

### For Project Managers
- Understand system capabilities and constraints
- Plan features within architectural boundaries
- Reference for technical requirements
- Guide for resource planning

## Maintenance

These specifications are living documents:
- **Updates**: Propose changes via OpenSpec workflow
- **Versioning**: Specs are versioned alongside code
- **Review**: Regular reviews to ensure relevance
- **Evolution**: Adapt as system grows and requirements change

## Questions or Feedback?

Use the OpenSpec workflow to propose changes:
```bash
/openspec-proposal Update [specific spec] to address [issue]
```
