# Proposal: Define Core System Specs for Project Starter Pro 2

**Status**: âœ… Validated - Ready for Apply
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Validated**: 2025-10-30
**Author**: Augment CLI

## Overview

This proposal defines the foundational system specifications for Project Starter Pro 2, establishing the architecture, core modules, data models, and operational standards that will guide all future development.

## Problem Statement

Project Starter Pro 2 currently lacks formal system specifications. Without clear architectural definitions, development will be inconsistent, integration will be difficult, and the system will lack coherent structure.

## Proposed Solution

Create comprehensive core system specifications covering:

1. **System Architecture** - Overall structure and component relationships
2. **Core Modules** - Essential functional components
3. **Data Models** - Persistent and transient data structures
4. **API Contracts** - Internal and external interfaces
5. **Development Standards** - Code quality, testing, and deployment practices
6. **Security & Privacy** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection

## Scope

### In Scope
- System architecture definition
- Core module specifications
- Data model schemas
- API interface contracts
- Development and deployment standards
- Security framework

### Out of Scope
- Specific feature implementations (handled in separate proposals)
- Third-party integrations (handled separately)
- UI/UX design specifications (separate domain)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create specification documents in `openspec/specs/`
2. Organize by domain: architecture, modules, data, api, standards, security
3. Each spec includes: purpose, requirements, interfaces, constraints
4. Review and validate against project goals
5. Archive proposal once specs are approved

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All core system domains have formal specifications
- [ ] Specifications are clear, complete, and actionable
- [ ] Development team can reference specs for implementation guidance
- [ ] Specs are versioned and maintainable

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundational specification effort.

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Over-specification leading to rigidity  
**Mitigation**: Keep specs focused on essential contracts, allow flexibility in implementation

**Risk**: Specs become outdated  
**Mitigation**: Use OpenSpec workflow to propose updates as system evolves

## Timeline

- Specification creation: 1-2 hours
- Review and refinement: As needed
- Approval and archival: Upon completion

## Next Steps

1. Create specification files in `openspec/specs/`
2. Populate each domain with detailed specifications
3. Review for completeness and consistency
4. Move to implementation phase with `/openspec-apply`
