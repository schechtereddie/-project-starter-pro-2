**Impact**: Established clear module boundaries and responsibilities for all core functionality.

---

### 2. Data Specification ✓
**Applied to**: `openspec/specs/data/spec.md`

- Complete directory structure (`/data/`, `/config/`, `/.augment/`)
- Data schemas for all entities (JSON/YAML/Markdown)
- Synchronization strategies (NAS/Cloud/Git)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Cache management with TTL and eviction

**Impact**: Defined complete data storage strategy with offline-first capability and human-readable formats.

---

- Notes Management API (create, search, AI features)
- Research Management API (import, synthesize)
- Analytics API (metrics, reports, predictions)
- Configuration API (settings management)
- External Sync API (upload/download)
- System Status API (health, version)

**Impact**: Established comprehensive REST API contracts for all system functionality.

---

### 4. Development Standards Specification ✓
**Applied to**: `openspec/specs/standards/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- Python standards (Black, flake8, pytest, mypy)
- Node.js/TypeScript standards (ESLint, Prettier, Jest)
- Git workflow (branch strategy, Conventional Commits)
- Documentation requirements (docstrings, project docs)
- Testing standards (80% minimum coverage)
- Deployment procedures (versioning, CI/CD)

**Impact**: Established consistent development practices and quality standards across the codebase.

---

### 5. Security Specification ✓
**Applied to**: `openspec/specs/security/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- Authentication (OS-level for local, JWT for team mode)
- Authorization (RBAC with 4 roles)
- Data encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Credential management (keyring, env vars, encrypted files)
- Input validation (path traversal, injection prevention)
- Security monitoring (audit logs, intrusion detection)
- Compliance (GDPR, data retention)

**Impact**: Established comprehensive security framework protecting user data and system integrity.
