# Proposal: Define Core System Specs for Project Starter Pro 2

**Status**: Ready for Apply  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Author**: Augment CLI  

## Overview

This proposal defines comprehensive core system specifications for Project Starter Pro 2, establishing the foundational architecture, modules, data models, APIs, development standards, and security framework.

## Problem Statement

Project Starter Pro 2 requires formal system specifications to guide development, ensure consistency, and establish best practices. Without these specifications, the system would lack:

- Clear architectural direction
- Consistent module interfaces
- Standardized data structures
- Well-defined API contracts
- Development and security standards

## Proposed Solution

Create five comprehensive specification documents covering all critical aspects of the system:

1. **Core Modules** - Functional modules and their responsibilities
2. **Data Specification** - Storage design, schemas, and synchronization
3. **API Specification** - Internal and external service interfaces
4. **Development Standards** - Code quality, workflow, and deployment
5. **Security Specification** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection

## Scope

### In Scope

- Complete module specifications (Project Manager, Notes Manager, Research Hub, Analytics Engine, Settings Manager)
- Data storage architecture and schemas
- REST API endpoints and contracts
- Development workflow and standards
- Security framework and best practices

### Out of Scope

- Specific feature implementations (handled in separate proposals)
- UI/UX design specifications
- Third-party integration details
- Performance optimization strategies

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Modules Specification

**Location**: `specs/modules/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- Project Manager - Project lifecycle management
- Notes Manager - Markdown notes with AI assistance
- Research Hub - Information gathering and synthesis
- Analytics Engine - Metrics, insights, and reporting
- Settings Manager - Configuration and preferences

**Key Features**:
- Clear module responsibilities
- Well-defined interfaces
- Data structure definitions
- API contracts for each module

### 2. Data Specification

**Location**: `specs/data/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- Local-first storage architecture
- Directory structure and organization
- Data schemas (JSON/YAML/Markdown)
- Synchronization strategy (NAS/Cloud/Git)
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Cache management

**Key Features**:
- Human-readable file formats
- Offline-first capability
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Data validation and migration

### 3. API Specification

**Location**: `specs/api/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- REST API endpoints for all modules
- Request/response formats
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling and status codes
- Rate limiting
- External sync APIs

**Key Features**:
- RESTful design principles
- Consistent response formats
- Comprehensive error handling
- Token-based authentication

### 4. Development Standards

**Location**: `specs/standards/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- Python code standards (Black, flake8, pytest)
- Node.js/TypeScript standards (ESLint, Prettier, Jest)
- Git workflow and commit conventions
- Documentation requirements
- Testing standards (80% coverage minimum)
- Deployment procedures

**Key Features**:
- Automated code formatting
- Comprehensive testing requirements
- Conventional commit messages
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

### 5. Security Specification

**Location**: `specs/security/spec.md`

**Contents**:
- Authentication (local and team modes)
- Authorization (RBAC and ACL)
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Credential management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security monitoring and audit logging

**Key Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Success Criteria

- [x] All five specification documents created
- [x] Specifications are comprehensive and detailed
- [x] Consistent structure across all specs
- [x] Clear examples and code snippets provided
- [x] References to relevant standards and best practices
- [ ] Specifications reviewed and validated
- [ ] Ready for implementation via `/openspec-apply`

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundational specification effort.

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Specifications may become outdated as system evolves  
**Mitigation**: Use OpenSpec workflow to propose updates; treat specs as living documents

**Risk**: Over-specification may limit flexibility  
**Mitigation**: Focus on essential contracts and interfaces; allow implementation flexibility

**Risk**: Specifications may not cover all edge cases  
**Mitigation**: Iterate and refine based on implementation feedback

## Timeline

- Specification creation: Complete ✓
- Review and validation: 1-2 days
- Implementation: Ongoing (via separate proposals)

## Next Steps

1. Review all specifications for completeness
2. Validate against project requirements
3. Run `/openspec-apply Define core system specs for Project Starter Pro 2`
4. Begin implementation following the specifications
5. Update specifications as needed via OpenSpec workflow

- Comprehensive coverage of their domains
- Practical examples and code snippets
- References to industry standards
- Clear, actionable guidance for implementation

The specifications are ready to guide the development of Project Starter Pro 2.
