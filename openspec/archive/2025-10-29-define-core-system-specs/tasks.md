## Next Actions

1. **Review Phase**
   - Read through all specifications
   - Check for consistency and completeness
   - Validate against project requirements
   - Identify any gaps or issues

2. **Validation Phase**
   - Ensure all specs align with architecture
   - Verify examples are correct
   - Check references are valid
   - Confirm best practices are current

3. **Apply Phase**
   - Run `/openspec-apply Define core system specs for Project Starter Pro 2`
   - Move specs to `openspec/specs/`
   - Archive this change proposal
   - Begin implementation

## Notes

All specifications follow the same high-quality structure as the existing System Architecture Specification. They provide:
